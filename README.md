# OggHunter
Find and extract Oggs embedded in other stuff. What were you expecting?

To set it up:

`bash
chmod +x ./OggHunter.py
`

To run it:

`bash
./OggHunter.py <file_in> <directory_out>
`

Where `<file_in>` is the file you suspect of having Oggs embedded in it, and `<directory_out>` is a directory into which you'd like to write the results.

Happy Ogg Hunting!
